**A powerful Discord token checker, it verifies if they are valid or not, if they are blocked, etc... If they are valid, it checks the amount of available boosts they have, if they don't have, if they have 1 or if they have 2 boosts. This tool is provided for educational purposes only in controlled environments, I am not responsible for any damage caused by misuse of this tool.**
